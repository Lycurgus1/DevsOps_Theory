## Concepts
**Continuous integration(CI)**
- Developers merge code to master branch multiple times a day.
- Fully automated build and test process

**Continuous deliveryCDEL)**
- Builds on CI. Release new changes to public in sustainable way
- Release process needs to be automated. 
- But deployment done manually

**Continuous deployment(CDEP)**
- Every change automatically deplayed to customers without human input

**CICD**
- Combination of CI and CDEL or CDEP. 
- Backbone of DevOps

**Four pillars**
- Ease of use
- Flexibility
- Robustness
- Cost 
    - Iterations save time

**CAMS model**
- Four important aspects(1-4 of most important to least)
- Culture 1
- Automation 2
- Measurement 3
- Sharing 4 
- Form pyramid

**Principles**
- Customer centric action
- End to end responsibility
- Continuous improvement
- Automate everything
- Work as one team
- Monitor and test everything

**Stages**
- Continuous Development
- Continuous Testing
- Continuous Integration
- Continuous Deployment
- Continuous Monitoring

**Implementation**
- Infrastructure as code (IaC)
- Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
- Infrastructure as a platform (IaaP)
- Infrastructure as a product


## Software
**Docker**
- Virtualisation platform
- Used for CI

**Jenkins**
- Used by netflix, facebook
- Open source automation service
- Based in Java

## Background
**Before DevOps**
- Software releases often took too long
- Too many dependencies between software
- Lack of communication between teams leads to release problems

**Service shifts**
- Infrastructure change to cloud from local storage
- Monolith services shift to microservices
